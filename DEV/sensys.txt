PORTS:
4 ports correspond to the 4 inputs.
#define TC1_PORT IN_1
#define US2_PORT IN_2
#define US3_PORT IN_3
#define TC4_PORT IN_4

TC1_PORT is the Touch Sensor on the Front of the car
US2_PORT is the REAR ultrasonic on the right side of the car
US3_PORT is the FRONT ultrasonic on the right side of the car
TC4_PORT is the Touch Sensor on the Rear of the car

VALUES:
#define REAR VAL_US2
#define FRONT VAL_US3
int InitialBaseRear;
int InitialBaseFront;
FRONT and REAR are integer values, corrected for error
InitBaseFront and InitBaseRear are integer values, corrected for error.

bool Touch1 = false;
bool Touch4 = false;
Touch1 is initially false, and turns to true when the front bump sensor hits something
Touch4 is initially false, and turns to true when the rear bump sensor hits something

INITIALIZATION:
These need to be done in main:

SetSensorLowspeed(US2_PORT);
SetSensorLowspeed(US3_PORT);
SetSensorTouch(TC1_PORT);
SetSensorTouch(TC4_PORT);


Sensys() is called from main by start Sensys;
Touchsys() is called from main by start Touchsys;


CALIBRATION:
For the ultrasonic sensor:
if 12 or less, subtract 2
if 13 to 22, subtract 3
if 23 to 30, subtract 1
