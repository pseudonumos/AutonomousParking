04/15/09 Milestone Report
Members: Irving Lin, Timothy Liu, Jonathan Fong, Tyler Latzke, Boyang Zhang

Hardware: Complete. Ready for software people to use.
+ 3 separate NXT models: 
    + 1 sensor-only frame
        - Contains only a frame with sensors for sensor calibration and usage.
    + 1 motor-only prototype 
        - With wheels, front axel pivot, and full chassis and with motors for motor calibration and usage.
    + 1 fully integrated and functional model
        - With sensors and motors for algorithm usage.

Software: In Progress.
+ 3 components:
    + Algorithm
        - We have completed the initial outlining and structure of the main algorithm. However, since the algorithm depends on the sensor and the motor algorithms' functions, it has been delayed due to those taking a bit longer to complete.
    + Sensor blackboxing
        - Provides a blackbox for the algorithm to access sensor data all neatly packaged into easy to access objects containing which sensor and current data.
        - This still needs to be completed for algorithms people to use.
        - Still needs to have sensor data calibrated properly and processed. Using raw data right now.
    + Motor blackboxing
        - Provides a blackbox for car movement so that the algorithm does not need to worry about whether the car moved.
        - Takes in a command to move in a direction for a specified distance.
        - Haven't decided on best way to implement functions (ie: separate drive and turn or drive with wheels turned x degrees)
        - Still need to calibrate exact distances and turning radiuses (by using sensor data).
        
Environment: Temporarily Complete. 
+ Parking Structure: 
    - Have decided on simple one-lane parking lot with parallel parking on right and head-in parking on left. 
    - Will make more elaborate once the car can handle this.
